Yesterday's traditional software development practices, architectures, organization structures, and leadership styles are a poor fit for today's new digital reality. Cloud, Mobile Apps, and Social Media are radically reshaping entire industries and also a game changer for software development.

While the new digital reality is driven by technology, it is actually people and teams who learn how to leverage this technology through software that are able to define a version of this new reality that benefits their customers and business.

> Knowledge is the currency of the information-age. In the race to thrive or survive, whoever can create knowledge the quickest, most cheaply and to the best fidelity will win.  - Barry O'Reilly


## What I Am Known For

I am a seasoned pragmatic software development leader with years of experience leading teams from 10-100 talented people and a track record of successful delivery of multiple large complex products.

Most importantly, I create the conditions for teams to succeed by getting the right people in the right place, provide clarity on desired outcomes, growing team capacity to continuously experiment, learn, grow, think big, act small, and enable them lead themselves by getting out of their way.

I leverage a deep working knowledge of Lean, Agile, Continuous Delivery, DevOps, and Cloud Native engineering approaches and apply these modern approaches to enable teams to improve their velocity, quality, agility, and ultimately business outcomes.

Network with and build authentic relationships with key leaders, stakeholders, up and downstream dependencies to connect the dots to business objectives, expedite communication, creating shared context, anticipate issues, manage expectations, avoid surprises, and keep things moving in the right direction.

Resilient, adaptable, and resourceful problem solver since change and obstacles are inevitable. Skilled at quickly getting the problem clearly articulated, getting multiple points of view, researching prior solutions, identifying and evaluating options, risks, costs, constraints, dependencies, and quickly experimenting to find a viable solution.
