Well, here we go with my first post on my new personal website built on gitpages and the Beautiful-Jekyll template.

I used to have a WordPress site and paid for hosting but, I never really got into it and eventually took it down.  There is nothing wrong with WordPress, it is very powerful and an amzing ecosystem built around it.

What changed for me to recreate a personal website was the need to build more of a on-line presence and share some things I have found useful.  
I knew if I could find a very simple, attractive, and low cost solution, I was more likely to keep it current and enjoy it.
The solution I've landed on is [Gitpages](https://pages.github.com/) on github.com along with the [beautiful-jekyll template](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) created by [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com/) (Thanks Dean!).

Here is why I chose this route:
1. GitHub Pages allows one **free** personal website per account. Zero cost!
2. I had a GitHub account already and use GitHub and GitHub Enterprise frequently so no learning curve for me.
3. GitPages used Markdown as the markup language which is simple to learn and use.
4. The ability to fork an existing GitHub repo for a simple, attractive jekyll template and get my site up in less than 5 minutes without having to install anything locally was too easy.
5. The beautiful-jekyll looks great on the desktop and mobile devices.
6. I've found it easy to modify the beautiful-jekyll fork to customize my site.  I was able to use google and search github to find solutions from other folks that are using the same template.

I still have a lot to learn and work to do to get my site looking great but, I've got a good start with out much effort.

Oh, and Happy Mother's Day too if you happen to be a mother.
